For other uses, see The Book of Life. In Christianity and Judaism, the Book of Life (Hebrew: \u05e1\u05e4\u05e8 \u05d4\u05d7\u05d9\u05d9\u05dd, transliterated Sefer HaChaim; Greek: \u03b2\u03b9\u03b2\u03bb\u03af\u03bf\u03bd \u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u03b6\u03c9\u1fc6\u03c2 Bibl\u00edon t\u0113s Z\u014d\u0113s) is the book in which God records the names of every person who is destined for Heaven or the World to Come. According to the Talmud it is open on Rosh Hashanah, as is its analog for the wicked, the Book of the Dead. For this reason extra mention is made for the Book of Life during Amidah recitations during the Days of Awe, the ten days between Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish new year, and Yom Kippur, the day of atonement (the two High Holidays, particularly in the prayer Unetaneh Tokef). Contents (hide) 1 In the Hebrew Bible 2 Book of Jubilees 3 References in the New Testament 4 The eschatological or annual roll-call 5 Fundraising 6 See also 7 Notes 8 References In the Hebrew Bible(edit) In the Hebrew Bible the Book of Life - the book or muster-roll of God - records forever all people considered righteous before God. God has such a book, and to be blotted out of it signifies death. It is with reference to the Book of Life that the holy remnant is spoken of as being written unto life in Jerusalem; compare also Ezekiel ix. 4, where one of the six heavenly envoys ``who had the scribe's inkhorn upon his loins'' is told to mark the righteous for life, while the remainder of the inhabitants of Jerusalem are doomed. The Psalmist likewise speaks of the Book of Life in which only the names of the righteous are written ``and from which the unrighteous are blotted out''. Even the tears of men are recorded in this Book of God. ``Every one that shall be found written in the book ... shall awake to everlasting life''. This book is probably identical with the ``Book of Remembrance'' in which are recorded the deeds of those that fear the Lord. Book of Jubilees(edit) The Book of Jubilees speaks of two heavenly tablets or books: a Book of Life for the righteous, and a Book of Death for those that walk in the paths of impurity and are written down on the heavenly tablets as adversaries (of God). Also, according to ib. xxxvi. 10, one who contrives evil against his neighbor will be blotted out of the Book of Remembrance of men, and will not be written in the Book of Life, but in the Book of Perdition. In Dan. vii. 10 and Enoch xlvii. 3 ``the Ancient of Days'' is described as seated upon His throne of glory with ``the Book'' or ``the Books of Life'' (``of the Living'') opened before Him. So are, according to Enoch civ. 1, the righteous ``written before the glory of the Great One,'' and, according to Enoch cviii. 3, the transgressors ``blotted out of the Book of Life and out of the books of the holy ones.'' To this Book of Life reference is made also in Hermas (Vision i. 3; Mandate viii.; Similitude ii.); in Rev. iii. 5, xiii. 8, xvii. 8, xx. 12-15, where ``two Books'' are spoken of as being ``opened before the throne, the Book of Life, and the Book of Death, in which latter the unrighteous are recorded together with their evil deeds, in order to be cast into the lake of fire.'' It is the Book of Life in which the apostles' names are ``written in heaven'' (Luke x. 20), or ``the fellow-workers'' of Paul (Phil. iv. 3), and ``the assembly of the first-born'' (Heb. xii. 23; compare I Clem. xlv.). To these Books of Records allusion is made also in Enoch lxxxi. 4, lxxxix. 61-77, xc. 17-20, xcviii. 76, civ. 7; Apoc. Baruch, xxiv. 1; Ascensio Isa. ix. 20. References in the New Testament(edit) The Book of Life is referred to seven times in the Book of Revelation (3:5 13:8 17:8 20:12 20:15 21:27 22:19) one of the books of the New Testament, attributed to John of Patmos. As described, only those whose names are written in the Book of Life from the foundation of the world, and have not been blotted out by the Lamb, are saved at the Last Judgment; all others are doomed. And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire (Rev. 20:15, King James Version). And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works. (Rev. 20:12, King James Version) It is also mentioned in Pauls letter to the Philippians 4:3. The eschatological or annual roll-call(edit) While the prevailing tendency among apocryphal writers of the Hasidean school was to give the Book of Life an eschatological meaning--and to this inclines also Targ. Jon. to Isa. iv. 3 and Ezek. xiii. 9 (compare Targ. Yer. to Ex. xxxii. 32)--the Jewish liturgy and the tradition relating to the New-Year's and Atonement days adhered to the ancient view which took the Book of Life in its natural meaning, preferring, from a sound practical point of view, the this-worldliness of Judaism to the heavenliness of the Essenes. Instead of transferring, as is done in the Book of Enoch, the Testament of Abraham, and elsewhere, the great Judgment Day to the hereafter, the Pharisaic school taught that on the first day of each year (Rosh ha-Shanah) God sits in judgment over His creatures and has the Books of Life together with the books containing the records of the righteous and the wicked. And out of the middle state of the future judgment (see Testament of Abraham, A, xiv.) there arose the idea of a third class of men who are no longer held in suspense. (Benonim, the middle), and of a corresponding third book for this all (R.H. 16b). In Tos. Sanh. xiii. 3, however, the annual (Rosh ha-Shanah) judgment (Yom ha-Din) is recognized (compare Tos. R.H. i. 13, R. Jose's opinion in opposition to that of R. Akiba and R. Me\u00efr, which has become the universally accepted one). The origin of the heavenly Book of Life must be sought in Babylonia, whereas the idea of the annual Judgment Day seems to have been adopted by the Jews under Babylonian influence in post-exilic times. The Babylonian legends speak of the Tablets of Destiny; also of the tablets of the transgressions, sins, and wrongdoings, of the curses and execrations, of a person which should be ``cast into the water''; that is, to be blotted out. As to the resemblance of the Babylonian Zagmuku or New-Year to the Jewish New-Year see the art. Rosh ha-Shanah. The living are the righteous (second half of the verse), who alone are admitted to citizenship in the theocracy. The wicked are denied membership therein: they are blotted out of God's book (Ex. xxxii. 32 et seq.). The figure is derived from the citizens' registers. The life which the righteous participate in is to be understood in a temporal sense. In Dan. xii. 1, however, those who are found written in the book and who shall escape the troubles preparatory to the coming of the Messianic kingdom are they who, together with the risen martyrs, are destined to share in the everlasting life referred to in verse 2. The eternal life is certainly meant in Enoch xlvii. 3, civ. 1, cviii. 3, and frequently in the New Testament (especially in Revelation). The Targum (Isa. iv. 3; Ezek. xiii. 9) speaks of the ``Book of Eternal Life.'' Temporal life is apparently prayed for in the liturgical formula: ``Inscribe us in the Book of Life'' (see Atonement, Day of). The Mishnah tells us that the deeds of every human being are recorded in a book (Abot, ii. 1; see iii. 16). The Sefer \u1e24asidim (xxxiii) pointedly adds that God is in no need of a book of records; ``the Torah speaks the language of man''; i.e., figuratively. Fundraising(edit) A book of life motif is frequently found in Jewish houses of worship. It is both a decorative feature and fundraiser. Some synagogues have raised money by inscribing congregation member's names in a ``book of life'' as a tribute to their financial generosity.

The song, which features R&B singer Dave Hollister, is about a 12-year-old girl named Brenda who lives in a ghetto and has a baby she can't support. The song explores the issue of teen pregnancy and its effect on young mothers and their families. Like many of Shakur's songs, ``Brenda's Got a Baby'' draws from the plight of the impoverished. Using Brenda to represent young mothers in general, Shakur criticises the low level of support from the baby's father, the government, and society in general. Shakur wrote the song when he read a newspaper article about a 12-year-old girl who became pregnant from her cousin and threw the baby into a trash compactor. Contents (hide) 1 Lyrics 2 Music video 3 Charts 4 References Lyrics(edit) The opening consists of a duet singing the song's title twice. Much of the rest of the song is one long verse performed by Tupac. The verse begins with Tupac telling a group that he has heard about Brenda's pregnancy. He also notes that she has had virtually no education, and calls this a ``damn shame'' because she has little hope of a future. Her family is very poor and her father is a drug addict. Brenda is impregnated by her unnamed boyfriend, who is also her cousin, but she is successfully able to hide her pregnancy. Tupac explains that her family wouldn't care if she gave birth, as long as they got their cut of the government assistance. Although she believes that her cousin (her baby's father) will stay with her and help her raise their child, he is merely a molester, and abandons her before she gives birth on the bathroom floor. She throws the baby into a trash bin but later retrieves it when she hears it crying. Her mother scolds her severely, and Brenda becomes so ashamed of herself that she runs away from home. Brenda is now forced to live alone, and unsuccessfully seeks employment. Her attempt to sell crack cocaine results in robbery, and eventually she views prostitution as her only way to earn money and survive. This life path leads to her getting murdered. The fates of her parents, her cousin, and the baby are left unexplained. The song's final minute consists of a chorus singing ``Don't you know she's got a baby?'' repeatedly. The beginning of the song can be heard in The Game's song ``Street Riders'' 2Pac has another song which he made late in his career which deals with this same subject called ``Mama's Just a Little Girl''. The song can be found on his fourth posthumous studio album Better Dayz. Music video(edit) The video of the song is in black-and-white. It was made to visualize what Shakur narrates. The first part shows Shakur and ``Brenda'' and then the actual story starts. Ethel ``Edy'' Proctor portrays Brenda. The video begins with ``based on a true story,'' although the characters themselves are fictitious, Shakur wrote the song after reading a story in the newspaper of a 12-year-old girl getting pregnant by her cousin and trying to dispose of the baby in a trash can. Parts of the video were included in Tupac: Resurrection, a 2003 documentary on 2Pac's life, in a television show later in the music video of Ghetto Gospel, in the music video of Changes and appears as a bonus in its entirety on the film's DVD. Part of the video and song was played in 2Pac's biopic film, ``All Eyez On Me,'' released June 16th 2017. The video was directed by the Hughes Brothers.
